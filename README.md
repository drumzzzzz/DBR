Database Reflection (DBR) via SQLite Project Library 

     A library tool that provides an abstraction to accessing SQLite type databases
     Created for UWGB Computer Science Fall semester, 2020.

This library attempts to reduce the hardcoding involved with SQLite database interaction
by providing returned queries via object Reflection. This allows the use of simpler 
class models which contain a single boilerplate method that casts the returned objects.
This can also reduces the dependency and overhead of implementing larger libraries (i.e. Entity Framework)
